# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This is my first ever machine learning project (and yes, I'm excited 😄). It uses a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours.

What started out as a curiosity about "how AI learns stuff" turned into a hands-on project that taught me the full pipeline — from loading data to building and evaluating a model.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Explored the relationship between hours studied and scores
- 📈 Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- 📊 Visualized data and the regression line using seaborn & matplotlib
- 📤 Made predictions and evaluated the model’s performance
- 🧪 Tested model with custom inputs (e.g., predicting scores for 9.25 hours)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/debb-major/student-performance-linear-regression
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook/student_scores_analysis.ipynb


💬 Final Thoughts
I had a lot of fun doing this project and learned so much about how models learn from data. Can't wait to take on more challenges!

Thanks for checking it out 💙
